## Course Description:
Develop your Python programming skills. Python is a great choice for building all kinds of applications, but to fully take advantage of its power and flexibility, you need to master all its advanced functionality. In this course, you can learn how to leverage next-level Python features such as object-oriented special class methods, use logging to track performance and user activity, see how to port code from Python 2 to 3, and make your code more efficient and easier to read and maintain. Instructor Joe Marini also shows how to manipulate data, build custom classes and functions, create lists, and write more elegant, optimized code.
